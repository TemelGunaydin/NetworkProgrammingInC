# Network Programming In C Language

> Chapter 1

    In the first chapter of our network programming, we first list all adapter names and IPV4 and IPV6 addresses of our computer.
    main.c program uses some API's that is included in unix based systems. Unfortunately code files do not cover windows api's.

> Chapter 2

    This chapter we learned how to make a connection using both Win sockets and Berkeley sockets. Also we defined some macros in order
    to deal with for Windows and Unix based systems.
